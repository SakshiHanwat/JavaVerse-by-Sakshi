## 📌 What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language** widely used to build:

* Web applications
* Mobile applications (Android)
* Desktop software
* Enterprise-level backend systems
* Cloud-based applications

Java is known for its **Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)** capability, meaning Java code can run on any platform that supports the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

Java syntax and structure are similar to other C-based languages such as **C++** and **C#**, making it easier to learn for developers familiar with those languages.

---

## 🧪 Basic Java Code Example

Below is a simple Java program that prints **"Hello, World!"** to the console:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

📖 To understand how this program works, refer to **Java Introduction**.
